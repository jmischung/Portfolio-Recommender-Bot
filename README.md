# Portfolio Recommender Bot with AWS Lex & Lambda

This project builds out an AWS Lex bot that utilizes an AWS Lambda function to recommend a portfolio to a user based on the user's responses to the bot's questions. The code used in the AWS Lamda function can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jmischung/Portfolio-Recommender-Bot/blob/main/lambda/lambda_function.py). Videos of the AWS Lex bot being tested are located in the videos folder.
